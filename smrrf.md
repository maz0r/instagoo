# SMRRF 2023 SAMPLES

## Why?

I was giving these out to get rid of the mountain of PVPK30 I had left over from making my own and some for a local printing business.

I have ZERO plans to sell this, so please refer to the vendor list on the main page if you want more in the future or enjoy the fun game of finding a listing on Aliexpress that isnt gone the next day.


## Mixing Instructions for the Airplane friendly (not premixed) Version.

These contain an premixed amount of PVP K30 and PVA (about 2.6g and 1.1g respecitvley) and just need the IPA & Water adding... 

  Apologies in advance for not providing a funnel it seemed wasteful since you can print your own in [vase mode](https://www.printables.com/model/145731-set-of-small-funnels-spiral-vase-mode-printable)

  1. Prepare your IPA / Distilled water mixture.

  - This should be approximately 50% IPA: Distilled Water
   
  - 50ml of 70:30 Rubbing alcohol is fine provided it doesnt contain things like Aloe
  
  - 25ml of 99% IPA mixed with 25ml of Distilled water is also fine. 

    > If you dont have distilled water, it can be easily produced at home and in the quantity required takes hardly any time (google it :p)


  2. With the mixture ready open the bottle and add the liquid.

  - Remove the Screw Cap (the seal should be intact)
   
  - Remove the small nozzle by gently twisting with a lever action on the tip.
  
  - Insert funnel and pour liquid

  3. Seal it back up and shake vigorously.

  - Optional you may find some sludge in the bottom, the measured amounts will 100% dissolve given enough rigorous shaking, but you can cheat by heating the liquid to ~60C (a warm print bed for 10 mins will do) and then shaking it for 30 seconds or so.
