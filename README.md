# Instagoo aka "Bed Adhesive" or "goo"
This is not my recipe, I've been making this for personal use, and have lots of ingredients left so figured I'd throw the instructions here, point a QR code at for instructions to mix that would be accessible to anyone.

If you got a bottle from me at SMRRF [you will find the mixing instructions here](./smrrf.md). It'll send you back to the application instructions after.

# DIY Bed Adhesive

Simply called "Bed Adhesive", Instagoo or simply goo is a
DIY bed adhesion solution formulated to aid print adhesion and build plate release agent for use in FDM printing.

Self sourcing the ingredients is possible, however certain ingredients can be difficult to source in the small quantities required for most of us so it is often easier to buy a kit or premix.

## Example Ingredients for 400ml of Concentrate (adjust as needed)

| Name      | Extended Name  | Purpose   | example for 400ml of concentrate |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| PVP-K30\* | Polyvinylpyrrolidone K 30 | Adhesive - Higher K values = Stronger Glue |  21g  |
| PVA       | Polyvinyl alcohol | Release Agent | 9g |
| IPA       | Isopropanol Alcohol | Part of the solution allows "flash off", and as PVP is soluble in IPA so its easier to mix this way. |  200ml |
| H2O       | **Distilled** Water | Part of the solution PVA is easily dissolvable in water so this forms a basis of creating the solution so it can be spread. |  200ml |

\**as an alternative 50 or 70% IPA can be used instead of the seperate 99% IPA + distilled water.*


## Solution & Mixture

Step 1:

Disolve the PVA in distilled water and stir/shake to dissolve - Heating this to ~60-70c can greatly speed up this process.

Step 2:

Add your PVP-K* powder to the IPA stir/shake to break up clumps.

Step 3:

Combine the two solutions in a suitable container.

Note: parts of the solution may be slightly sludgy at this point, warming the solution OR adding more IPA is a valid means of breaking this gelatinous remainder down.


Alternative method:

Add all the powder and liquid into a single container, shake and/or stir vigorously. 


## Usage

### Build plate prep

Commonly people use IPA to clean build plates, this is a terrible idea as IPA is not a degreaser it just moves any oils (i.e. from skin) around the surface before flashing off leaving the oil behind.

The build plate should be cleaned with Hot Soapy water, rinsed and dried with clean paper towels or clean microfiber cloth.

### Application (Brush)

Apply a thin coating of the solution with approx. 1 drop per 30cm² (adjust for dilution).

Adding additional IPA will cause the solution to flash off faster so for this method dilution with Distilled Water is recommended to allow the solution to be spread before the liquid evaporates.

Once applied sit the build surface on a warm print bed and let things dry thouroughly, for some surfaces (i.e. steel several initial coats may be needed depending on dilution)

Re-application may be needed after several prints (note this number varies based on material, but some users have reported needing to re-apply every 5 prints while others report >30 prints without re-application is fine).

### Application (Spray)

This method utilises an atomising/fine mist spray bottle like those commonly used for wetting hair. (ScAmazon has these listed as "Continuous Water Mister Spray Bottle")

Diluting the solution with **IPA** in the mister bottle at a ratio of 10:1 works well, but a more dilute solution is viable for more frequent re-application.

## Plastics

This adhesive will worth with most plastics including CFPEEK/PEEK/PEK/PEI/PVDF/PPSU/PVA/PC/NYLON/HIPS/ABS/ASA/PETG/PLA however it will not worth with PP or POM.

The concentration of the solution on the build plate may need to be varied for some polymers or surfaces as for instance the warping forces of materials like PEEK are far greater than those of ABS, and similarly Steel grips differently to PEI or PEX/Build-tak
